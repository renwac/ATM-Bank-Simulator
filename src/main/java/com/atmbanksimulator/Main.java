// 🧍Think of MVC like a human body:
// - View is the face and senses: it shows things and receives input.
// - Controller is the nerves: it carries signals to the brain and triggers actions.
// - UIModel is the brain: it holds state and logic, and queries domain services.
// - Bank / BankAccount are the real "money world" rules.
// Together, they simulate how an ATM thinks, reacts, and handles money.
